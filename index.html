            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a strategic management student with a passion for solving complex business challenges. My academic journey has equipped me with analytical frameworks and critical thinking skills that I apply to real-world problems. I believe that every organization, regardless of size or industry, can benefit from clear strategic thinking and data-driven decision making.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout my studies, I have developed expertise in competitive analysis, market research, and organizational strategy. I approach each project with curiosity and rigor, seeking to understand not just what is happening, but why it matters and what can be done about it. My goal is to bridge the gap between theory and practice, helping businesses navigate uncertainty and capitalize on opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academics, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I actively seek out opportunities to apply my skills in consulting projects, case competitions, and collaborative team environments. I thrive when working alongside talented individuals who share a commitment to excellence and a desire to make a meaningful impact.
